My idea was similar to the Knight Tour algorithm, though I didn't really think about it until we mentioned it in class.

Movement Priority: up, right, down, left

1. Start somewhere.
2. Look at the 4 possible moves you can make in movement priority order.
3. If yay, then move forward. Record movement by marking the tile you're standing on. (numbers? symbols?)
4. If nay, then move back. Remove the marking on the tile you were just standing on.
	probably by checking if surrounded by marked tiles/walls
5. Repeat until the end has been found.
