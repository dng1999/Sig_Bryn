1. Split deck into two piles.
2. Continue to split until each pile consists of only one card.
3. If there is only one card in a pile, the pile is sorted. Return the card to pile it came from.
4. When both halves of the pile return, sort the pile by least value to greatest value.
5. If one half of the pile is empty and the other half isn't, then it's safe to assume that the non-empty pile is sorted and there's no need to sort it again.
6. Repeat until you only have one pile in total left.
